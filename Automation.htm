        <h1>What is Automation Testing?</h1><br>
        <p Style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Automation testing is the process of testing software and other tech products to ensure it meets strict requirements. Essentially, it’s a test to double-check that the equipment or software does exactly what it was designed to do. It tests for bugs, defects, and any other issues that can arise with product development.
            
            Although some types of testing, such as regression or functional testing can be done manually, there are greater benefits of doing it automatically. Automation testing can be run at any time of the day. It uses scripted sequences to examine the software. It then reports on what’s been found, and this information can be compared with earlier test runs. Automation developers generally write in the following programming languages: C#, JavaScript, and Ruby.
            
            Many software businesses will have an appointed QA (quality assurance) automation tester. They design and write the test scripts in the beginning stages. The QA automation tester will work with automation test engineers and product developers to actually test the software and products. They will form a team and control the test automation initiatives, and use different types of test automation frameworks to establish the best one for successful test automation.</p>

    Some teams simply don’t have the time or resources to be manually testing software. Automation can help with this. It can significantly reduce the time it takes to test products because it runs quickly and efficiently. This puts time back into the hands of developers and production managers, who can divert their efforts into other aspects of the project. It can greatly boost productivity as a result.
    
    Using automation technology also means that testing can be done more frequently, improving overall functionality. Software development cycles call for repeated testing, often the same test over and over again. Automation testing makes this possible, without taking team members away from other work. It can also deliver more accurate and reliable results than manual testing alone. Further ensuring that the product is ready for market or to move onto the next stage of development. This validation gives the team a boost to continue developing.
    
    Most importantly, automation benefits product development. That’s because when software, an app, or another product can be designed and produced more efficiently, it makes way for continuous development once it's been launched. Essentially, the business will be able to work on more software and products, even with the same amount of team members, thanks to automation. Not only does this mean they perfect the final products they put out, but it also means they are creating new software all the time.</p>
