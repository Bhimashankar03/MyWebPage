<h1 style="padding:30px">Why Automation Testing is needed?</h1>

    Some teams simply don’t have the time or resources to be manually testing software. Automation can help with this. It can significantly reduce the time it takes to test products because it runs quickly and efficiently. This puts time back into the hands of developers and production managers, who can divert their efforts into other aspects of the project. It can greatly boost productivity as a result.
    
    Using automation technology also means that testing can be done more frequently, improving overall functionality. Software development cycles call for repeated testing, often the same test over and over again. Automation testing makes this possible, without taking team members away from other work. It can also deliver more accurate and reliable results than manual testing alone. Further ensuring that the product is ready for market or to move onto the next stage of development. This validation gives the team a boost to continue developing.
    
    Most importantly, automation benefits product development. That’s because when software, an app, or another product can be designed and produced more efficiently, it makes way for continuous development once it's been launched. Essentially, the business will be able to work on more software and products, even with the same amount of team members, thanks to automation. Not only does this mean they perfect the final products they put out, but it also means they are creating new software all the time.</p>
