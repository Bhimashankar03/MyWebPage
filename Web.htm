            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>   
 <p Style="text-align:justify;"> &nbsp;&nbsp; For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>

<h1 style="padding:30px">Why Automation Testing is needed?</h1>
<div class="row" style="padding:30px">
    
    
        <div class="col-lg-6">
   
   <p Style="text-align:justify;">
    Some teams simply don’t have the time or resources to be manually testing software. Automation can help with this. It can significantly reduce the time it takes to test products because it runs quickly and efficiently. This puts time back into the hands of developers and production managers, who can divert their efforts into other aspects of the project. It can greatly boost productivity as a result.
    
    Using automation technology also means that testing can be done more frequently, improving overall functionality. Software development cycles call for repeated testing, often the same test over and over again. Automation testing makes this possible, without taking team members away from other work. It can also deliver more accurate and reliable results than manual testing alone. Further ensuring that the product is ready for market or to move onto the next stage of development. This validation gives the team a boost to continue developing.
    
    Most importantly, automation benefits product development. That’s because when software, an app, or another product can be designed and produced more efficiently, it makes way for continuous development once it's been launched. Essentially, the business will be able to work on more software and products, even with the same amount of team members, thanks to automation. Not only does this mean they perfect the final products they put out, but it also means they are creating new software all the time.</p>
